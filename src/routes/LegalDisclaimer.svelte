<h2 class="subtitle">
  1. Content Guidelines
</h2>
<p>
  At Limit Labs, we're proud to foster a creative community that celebrates self-expression and individuality. We want every artist and customer to feel inspired while also ensuring our platform remains safe, respectful, and compliant with legal standards.
  <br>
  By submitting artwork to our customization tool, you agree to follow these content guidelines:
</p>
<h2 class="grouptitle">
  Ethical Treatment
</h2>
<p>
  We value the dignity and rights of all living beings. Artwork that depicts or references the victimization, abuse, or torture of people or animals will not be accepted for printing.
</p>
<h2 class="grouptitle">
  Inclusivity and Respect
</h2>
<p>
  We are committed to maintaining an inclusive and welcoming community. We do not accept artwork that promotes, references, or glorifies:
</p>
<p>
  • Hate speech or hate groups
<br>
  • Terrorism or violent extremism
<br>
  • Discrimination or harassment based on race, gender, sexuality, religion, disability, or any other protected trait
</p>
<h2 class="grouptitle">
  Non-Explicit Content
</h2>
<p>
  While we appreciate art that explores the human form, we must maintain a professional and legally compliant environment. We cannot print or distribute artwork containing:
</p>
<p>
  • Nudity that includes visible genitals or explicit sexual activity
<br>
  • Pornographic or sexually explicit imagery
<br>
  • Graphic depictions of violence or self-harm
</p>
<h2 class="grouptitle">
  Language Use
</h2>
<p>
  We believe in the creative power of words, but we do not accept artwork containing:
</p>
<p>
  • Profanity or sexually explicit language
<br>
  • Language promoting hate, violence, or illegal activity
</p>
<h2 class="grouptitle">
  Enforcement
</h2>
<p>
  Limit Labs reserves the right to refuse to print or cancel, with notice, any order that does not adhere to these guidelines. Repeat or severe violations may result in account suspension or a permanent ban from our services.
</p>
<h2 class="grouptitle">
  Our Purpose
</h2>
<p>
  These guidelines exist not to restrict creativity, but to protect our community, employees, and business from legal and ethical risk. We deeply respect artistic freedom, but some content—such as explicit sexual material or hate-related imagery—cannot legally or responsibly be reproduced by us.
</p>
<p>
  Thank you for helping us maintain a creative, respectful, and safe environment for all. We're excited to see what you create!
